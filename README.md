# To-Do_Project

**This is my first project using Django REST Framework (DRF) and JWT authentication.**

> This project is for learning purposes only — a simple Task & Project management API to practice Django, DRF, and JWT-based auth.

## Features ✅

- Projects and Tasks models with relations
- JWT authentication using `djangorestframework-simplejwt`
- Permission checks (owners, assigned users, admin)
- Example serializers and view functions for API operations

# Refactor Details
In this refactor I will use ViewSets and Routers and Create Custom Permissions
